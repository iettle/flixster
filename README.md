### Notes
I tried to add in the detail screen for the collection view but ran into a few errors and decided to cut it out. I had two many swift folders and know to split them up in groups for the next assignment.

### Notes
I ran into a lot of issues with autolayout. I wasn't happy with the final result on the smaller screen I used, and the lauch screen for the smaller screen had some issues (the "Flix" text was cut off).
